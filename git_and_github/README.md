# Git and GitHub Cheat-Sheet

## Overview
This cheat sheet provides a quick reference guide to Git, a free and open-source version control system, and GitHub, a platform for hosting Git repositories. It includes basic commands, concepts, and workflows to help you manage and collaborate on projects efficiently.

---

## What is Version Control?
Version control is a system for tracking changes to collections of information, such as:
- Documents
- Programs
- Websites

It enables you to review your changes, debug issues, and revert to previous versions when necessary.

---

## Key Terms
- **Directory**: A folder.
- **Terminal/Command Line**: A text-based interface for running commands.
- **CLI (Command Line Interface)**: Another term for the terminal.
- **Repository**: A project folder managed by Git.
- **GitHub**: A website for hosting Git repositories online.

---

## Common Git Commands

### Repository Management
- `git init`: Create a new local repository.
- `git clone <repo-url>`: Clone a remote repository to your machine.
- `git remote add origin <repo-url>`: Link a local repository to a remote repository.

### Tracking Changes
- `git status`: Check the status of files (staged, modified, or untracked).
- `git add <file>`: Stage changes for commit.
- `git commit -m "message"`: Save changes with a descriptive message.

### Synchronizing with Remote Repositories
- `git push origin <branch>`: Push commits to a remote repository.
- `git pull origin <branch>`: Pull the latest changes from a remote repository.

## SSH Keys for Secure Authentication
Generate SSH keys for secure authentication with GitHub:
1. Run: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<your-email>"`
2. Upload the public key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`) to GitHub.
3. Configure your SSH agent:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

---

## Working with Branches
- `git branch`: List all branches.
- `git branch <name>`: Create a new branch.
- `git checkout <name>`: Switch to a branch.
- `git merge <branch>`: Merge changes from another branch into the current branch.

---

## Undoing Changes
- `git restore <file>`: Discard changes in the working directory.
- `git reset <file>`: Unstage a file.
- `git log`: View the commit history.

---

## Example Workflow
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Make changes and stage them:  
   `git add <file>`
3. Commit your changes:  
   `git commit -m "descriptive message"`
4. Push to the remote repository:  
   `git push origin main`

---

## Tips and Best Practices
- **Commit Messages**: Write meaningful and descriptive commit messages to document your changes.
- **Branching**: Use branches to isolate features and bug fixes.
- **Pull Requests**: Collaborate by submitting pull requests to propose changes.
