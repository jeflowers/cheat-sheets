## GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM Error Message Information ##

The error message "Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set)" occurs when Git is unable to find the `.git` directory in the current or parent directories of the working directory, and it stops searching once it reaches a filesystem boundary (e.g., the root directory `/`).

This typically happens in these scenarios:

1. **You're outside a Git repository**:
   - The current directory is not inside a Git repository, so Git cannot find a `.git` directory.

2. **You have mounted or linked filesystems**:
   - The `.git` directory or parts of the repository might be on a different filesystem (e.g., in a mounted drive or symlinked directory), and Git stops at the boundary.

---

### To Resolve:
#### 1. **Ensure you're in a Git repository**
   - Run `git status` or `ls -a` to confirm if there's a `.git` directory in your current working directory.
   - If not, navigate to the correct project directory containing the `.git` folder.

#### 2. **Set the `GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM` environment variable**
   - If your repository is spread across different filesystems (e.g., symlinks or mounted directories), set this environment variable to `1`:
     ```bash
     export GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM=1
     ```
   - This tells Git to search for the `.git` directory across filesystem boundaries.

#### 3. **Check for symlinks or mounts**
   - If your project involves symlinked directories or mounted filesystems, ensure you are operating from the correct path.
