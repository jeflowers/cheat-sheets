NIMS:

Questions To Think About:
What kinds of resources do you expect an environment for this course to have, and how would it be different from your local compute environment?
How different would things be if one of your microservices were running on another host environment (publicly-accessible or gated)?
Same Idea, Different Question: How hard would it be to mimic the functionality of a local microservice despite being served by a remote host, and are there any inherent drawbacks of doing this?
What kinds of microservices do you actually need to spin up on a per-user basis, and what kinds are better left to run persistently?
